## Configuration

### Creating Roles and Permissions

Create roles and permissions using the following commands or directly in your database seeders.

```php
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

// Creating a role
$role = Role::create(['name' => 'admin']);

// Creating a permission
$permission = Permission::create(['name' => 'edit articles']);

// Assign permission to role
$role->givePermissionTo($permission)


//Assigning Roles to Users
You can assign roles to users using the following methods:

---

```php
use App\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);
$user->assignRole('admin');


//Usage
//Checking Roles and Permissions
//Check if a user has a specific role or permission:


$user->hasRole('admin'); // returns boolean
$user->hasPermissionTo('edit articles'); // returns boolean
Middleware
Protect your routes using role and permission middleware:

Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:admin']], function () {
    Route::get('/admin', [AdminController::class, 'index']);
});

Route::group(['middleware' => ['permission:edit articles']], function () {
    Route::get('/articles/edit', [ArticleController::class, 'edit']);
});
//Blade Directives
//Use Blade directives to show or hide content based on roles or permissions:

//blade File code

@role('admin')
    <p>This is visible to users with the admin role.</p>
@endrole

@can('edit articles')
    <p>This is visible to users with the edit articles permission.</p>
@endcan

## Documentation, Installation, and Usage Instructions

See the [documentation](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/) for detailed installation and usage instructions.

## What It Does
This package allows you to manage user permissions and roles in a database.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
// Adding permissions to a user
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// Adding permissions via a role
$user->assignRole('writer');

$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Because all permissions will be registered on [Laravel's gate](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization), you can check if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

## Alternatives

- [Povilas Korop](https://twitter.com/@povilaskorop) did an excellent job listing the alternatives [in an article on Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com/two-best-roles-permissions-packages). In that same article, he compares laravel-permission to [Joseph Silber](https://github.com/JosephSilber)'s [Bouncer]((https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer)), which in our book is also an excellent package.
- [santigarcor/laratrust](https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust) implements team support
- [ultraware/roles](https://github.com/ultraware/roles) (archived) takes a slightly different approach to its features.
- [zizaco/entrust](https://github.com/zizaco/entrust) offers some wildcard pattern matching
